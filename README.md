# TuneFlow Python Plugin Examples

## Run the demo plugins

You will need to install all dependencies by running:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, change the plugin we are debugging in `src/debug.py` to the plugin you want to run.

Then, within the `src` directory, run:
``` bash
python debug.py
```

You will see the demo plugin loaded in a local debug server.
